# Tictactoe-java
Tic-Tac-Toe mini game using Java language.
Here player can select  the rows as 0th,1st and 2nd row and columns also same as rows 0th,1st and 2nd.
For example: If I want to select 1st box I have to give input as 0 0 and If I want to select center box I have to give input as 1 1 which means 1st row's 1st column's element.

Thankyou.
